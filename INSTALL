Installation instructions

1. Installing dependencies
    Libraries needs to be installed for compile code correctly:
    -   gmp (libgmp-dev packet)
    -   libssh  (libssh-dev packet)
    -   bzip2 (libbzip2-dev packet)
    Applications used for compiling and testing
    -   make
    -   cmake
    -   python3
    -   openssl
    -   openssh-server
    -   ctest
    -   g++
    On linux run command `apt-get make cmake python3 openssl openssh-server ctest g++ install libgmp-dev libssh-dev libbz2-dev` or equivalent

1.1 Systems limitation
    It's impossible to build the server executable on windows system due to POSIX system call mmap unavailable on microsoft systems.

2. Generating make instruction for compiling
    Create build directory running
    -   mkdir build && cd build
    Generate make instruction running
    -   cmake ..

3. Compile executables and tests
    Run
    - make

4. Finalize compilation and generate necessary files
    Run
    -   cp ../finalize.sh finalize.sh
    -   sh finalize.sh

5. Compiled files in correct configuration and dependencies are now available inside "build/Compiled" directory.
    Make sure Utils and Server directories aren't available on the same machin for securety reasons.
    Configure client by editing "client.properties" inside "build/Compiled/Client" directory
    Configure server by editing "config.propeties" inside "build/Compiled/Server" directory

6. Enjoy =)
