Installation instructions

1. Installing dependencies
    Libraries needed for compile code correctly:
    -   gmp (libgmp-dev packet)
    -   libssh  (libssh-dev packet)
    -   bzip2 (libbzip2-dev packet)
    Applications used for compiling and testing
    -   make
    -   cmake
    -   python3
        *   python libraries required
            * pycrypto (`pip3 install pycrypto`)
    -   openssl
    -   openssh-server
    -   ctest
    -   g++
    On linux run command `apt-get make cmake python3 openssl openssh-server ctest g++ install libgmp-dev libssh-dev libbz2-dev` or equivalent

1.1 Systems limitation
    It's impossible to build the server executable on windows system due to POSIX system call mmap unavailable on microsoft systems.

====================================================================
2. Generating make instruction for compiling
    Create build directory running
    -   mkdir build && cd build
    Generate make instruction running
    -   cmake ..

2.1. Compile executables and tests
    Run
    -	make

2.2. Finalize compilation and generate necessary files
    Run
    -   cp ../finalize.sh finalize.sh
    -   sh finalize.sh

2.3. Compiled files in correct configuration and dependencies are now available inside "build/Compiled" directory.
    Make sure Utils and Server directories aren't available on the same machin for securety reasons.
    Configure client by editing "client.properties" inside "build/Compiled/Client" directory
    Configure server by editing "config.propeties" inside "build/Compiled/Server" directory

2.4. Run test by executing
    -   cd Test/test
    -   ctest
================================OR==================================
2b. Run Install script if you are in Linux env
	Run
	-	sh install_linux.sh
====================================================================
